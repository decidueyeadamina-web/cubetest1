        //at first, the sounds had to be automatic so everything was placed under update, which I changed here.

        // ok so! the scripts inside the if/then statement call on the audio to be played
        //the ontriggerenter is for when 2 colliders make contact (the parameters are specifically for 3D)
        //line 28 is specifically about which tag the game object that the script is attached to has to make contact with for the inner script to trigger
